# Face-Verification-System
This system is designed using the pre-build model. The paper "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering" is taken as reference. All thanks to Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko and James Philbin who are the original creator of this resource.

**Steps for running Face Verification System**

All thanks to the work of authors(Schroff, F., Kalenichenko, D. and Philbin, J., 2015.). This system is based on their work and model they trained.
Step 1: Download the pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EXPBSXwTaqrSC0OhUdXNmKSh9qJUQ55-).
Step 2: Download the code.
Step 3: Download the [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz) images for verification.
Step 4: Put all the those LFW images on "Face-Verification-System/Images/lfw 2" folder.
Step 5: Run Application_Interface.py.

Now you are ready to compare two images.
Step 1: Click on the button **Upload Real Image** and upload image.
Step 2: Click on the button **Upload Image to Compare** and upload another image.
Step 3: Click on the button **Compare Images**.

You will see result in the Result section down below.
